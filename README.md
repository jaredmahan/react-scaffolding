# react-scaffolding
Scaffolding With Typescript Web Pack, React, Redux, and Redux-Thunk Middleware for async actions

This is a scaffolding project that I plan to continue to refine as the days pass. The idea is that in the end this project includes
scaffolding for the following:

1. Unit Testing using BDD
2. Configurations for various enviroments (Dev,Integration, Stage Prod)
3. Code coverage reporting
4. CI through a build server
